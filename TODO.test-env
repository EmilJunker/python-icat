			   Test environment
			   ================

This is the test environment feature branch.  The goal is to improve
the test environment such that a "make test" or "python setup.py test"
will run the complete test suite.  Once this is done, the tests
subdirectory should be included in the distribution.  Ultimately
switch to test driven development, e.g. add a test for each bug or
missing feature first before fixing it.


TODO:

 + Implement "python setup.py test".  This will depend on "python
   setup.py build".

 + Make sure the tests import python-icat from build/lib/icat instead
   of the installed version from site-packages.

 + Make test_00_info.py work with all Python versions.

 + Add more tests.  Tests that access a life ICAT server will require
   manual configuration of the server and will be skipped by default.
