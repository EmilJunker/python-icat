			   Test environment
			   ================

This is the test environment feature branch.  The goal is to improve
the test environment such that a "make test" or "python setup.py test"
will run the complete test suite.  Once this is done, the tests
subdirectory should be included in the distribution.  Ultimately
switch to test driven development, e.g. add a test for each bug or
missing feature first before fixing it.


TODO:

 + Implement "python setup.py test".  This will depend on "python
   setup.py build".
   -> Done

 + Make sure the tests import python-icat from build/lib/icat instead
   of the installed version from site-packages.
   -> Done

 + Make test_00_info.py work with all Python versions.
   -> Done (actually found a better solution)

 + Add tests that access a life ICAT server.  These will require
   manual configuration of the server and should be skipped by default.
   -> Done

 + Add more tests:
   - getversion and test login.
     -> Done
   - full workflow cycle (init server, create investigations, add content).
     -> Done, but didn't deal with parameters, collections and jobs yet.
   - icatdump and icatrestore.
   - query.
   - IDS upload and download.
   - Bugs and Features (e.g. review change history and see if we can
     retroactively add tests for the fixed bugs).
