		  History of changes to python-icat
		  =================================

* Version 0.2.0 (not yet released)

 + Rework internals of icat.config.

 + Bugfix: Config required a password to be set even if prompt for
   password was requested.

 + Add support for configuration via environment variables.

 + Add support of HTTP proxy settings.  [Suggested by Alistair Mills]

 + WARNING, incompatible change!
   The configuration read by icat.config is not stored as attributes
   on the Config object itself, but rather getconf() returns an object
   with these attributes set.  This keeps the configuration values
   cleanly separated from the attributes of the Config object.

   In the client code, replace:

   conf = icat.config.Config()
   conf.getconfig()

   by

   config = icat.config.Config()
   conf = config.getconfig()

 + Move ConfigError from icat.config to icat.exception.

 + Move GenealogyError from icat.icatcheck to icat.exception.

* Version 0.1.0 (released 2013-11-01)
