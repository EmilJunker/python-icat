		  History of changes to python-icat
		  =================================

* Version 0.3.0 (not yet released)

 + Add a client method assertedSearch().

 + Add entity methods Group.getUsers() and
   Instrument.getInstrumentScientists().

 + WARNING, incompatible change!
   Changed entity methods Instrument.addInstrumentScientist() and
   Investigation.addInvestigationUser() to not to create the
   respective user any more, but rather expect a list of existing
   users as argument.  Renamed Group.addUser(),
   Instrument.addInstrumentScientist(), and
   Investigation.addInvestigationUser() to addUsers(),
   addInstrumentScientists(), and addInvestigationUsers() (note the
   plural "s") respectively.

   In the client code, replace:

   pi = investigation.addInvestigationUser(uid, fullName=userName, 
                                           search=True, 
                                           role="Principal Investigator")

   by

   pi = client.createUser(uid, fullName=userName, search=True)
   investigation.addInvestigationUsers([pi], role="Principal Investigator")

* Version 0.2.0 (2013-11-18)

 + Rework internals of icat.config.

 + Bugfix: Config required a password to be set even if prompt for
   password was requested.

 + Add support for configuration via environment variables.

 + Add support of HTTP proxy settings.  [Suggested by Alistair Mills]

 + WARNING, incompatible change!
   The configuration read by icat.config is not stored as attributes
   on the Config object itself, but rather getconf() returns an object
   with these attributes set.  This keeps the configuration values
   cleanly separated from the attributes of the Config object.

   In the client code, replace:

   conf = icat.config.Config()
   conf.getconfig()

   by

   config = icat.config.Config()
   conf = config.getconfig()

 + Move ConfigError from icat.config to icat.exception.

 + Move GenealogyError from icat.icatcheck to icat.exception.

 + Review export of symbols.  Most client programs should only need to
   import icat and icat.config.

* Version 0.1.0 (2013-11-01)
