      python-icat - A library for writing ICAT clients in Python
      ==========================================================

This package provides a collection of modules for writing Python
programs that access an ICAT[1] service using the SOAP interface.  It
is based on Suds and extends it with ICAT specific features.


System Requirements
-------------------

 + Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, or 3.2.
   The IDS client in python-icat has issues with Python 3.3 and 3.4,
   otherwise these Python version work as well.
   Python 2.6 requires patching the sources, see below.
   Python 2.5 is too old and will not work.

 + Suds, either the original version[2] or the fork by Jurko
   GospodnetiÄ‡[3].  The latter is recommended as the original version
   is not maintained any more and contains bugs.  Python 3 requires
   the jurko fork.

 + PyYAML[4]
   Only needed to use the YAML backend of icatdump.py and
   icatrestore.py and to run the example scripts.  Not required to
   install or use python-icat itself.

 + lxml[5]
   Only needed to use the XML backend of icatdump.py and
   icatrestore.py.  Not required to install or use python-icat itself.

 + argparse[6]
   Only if you are using Python 2.6 or 3.1, argparse became part of
   the Python standard library in 2.7 and 3.2 respectively.


Installation
------------

python-icat follows the standard Python conventions of packaging
source distributions.  See the documentation on Installing Python
Modules [7] for details or to customize the install process.

  1. Download the sources, unpack, and change into the source
     directory.

  2. Build:
     $ python setup.py build

  3. Install:
     $ python setup.py install

(If you are reading this, you probably already did the first step.)
The last step might require admin privileges in order to write into
the site-packages directory of your Python installation.

If you are using Python 2.6 or older, apply python2_6.patch after the
first step:

 1a. Patch:
     $ patch -p0 < python2_6.patch

It removes the use of dict comprehensions and of the bytes string
literal prefix 'b' which were introduced in Python 2.7.
