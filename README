      python-icat - A library for writing ICAT clients in Python
      ==========================================================

This package provides a collection of modules for writing Python
programs that access an ICAT[1] service using the SOAP interface.  It
is based on Suds[2] and extends it with ICAT specific features.


System Requirements
-------------------

 + Python 2.7
   Python 2.6 will do for most of python-icat.  Only the module
   icat.icatcheck won't compile with 2.6, but this module is mainly
   useful for the package maintainer and not needed for most users.

 + Suds 0.4

 + PyYAML[3]
   Only needed to run the example scripts.  Not required to install or
   use python-icat itself.


Installation
------------

python-icat follows the standard Python conventions of packaging
source distributions.  See the documentation on Installing Python
Modules [4] for details or to customize the install process.

 1. Download the sources, unpack, and change into the source
    directory.

 2. Build:
    $ python setup.py build

 3. Install:
    $ python setup.py install

(If you are reading this, you probably already did the first step.)
The last step might require admin privileges in order to write into
the site-packages directory of your Python installation.
