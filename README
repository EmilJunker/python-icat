	    python-icat - Python interface to ICAT and IDS
	    ==============================================

This package provides a collection of modules for writing Python
programs that access an ICAT[1] service using the SOAP interface.  It
is based on Suds and extends it with ICAT specific features.


System requirements
-------------------

Python:

 + Python 2.6, 2.7, or 3.1 and newer.
   Python 2.6 requires patching the sources, see below.
   Python 2.5 is too old and will not work.

Required Library packages:

 + Suds, either the original version[2] or the fork by Jurko
   Gospodnetić[3].  The latter is recommended as the original version
   is not maintained any more and contains bugs.  Python 3 requires
   the jurko fork.

 + argparse[4]
   Only if you are using Python 2.6 or 3.1, argparse became part of
   the Python standard library in 2.7 and 3.2 respectively.

Optional library packages, only needed to use certain extra features,
not required to install or use python-icat itself:

 + PyYAML[5]
   Only needed to use the YAML backend of icatdump.py and
   icatingest.py and to run the example scripts (see below).

 + lxml[6]
   Only needed to use the XML backend of icatdump.py and
   icatingest.py.

 + Requests[7]
   Only needed for the example scripts using the ICAT RESTful
   interface, icatexport.py and icatimport.py.

 + pytest[8]
   Only if you want to run the tests.


Installation
------------

python-icat follows the standard Python conventions of packaging
source distributions.  See the documentation on Installing Python
Modules [9] for details or to customize the install process.

  1. Download the sources, unpack, and change into the source
     directory.

  2. Build:
     $ python setup.py build

  3. Test (optional, see below):
     $ python setup.py test

  4. Install:
     $ python setup.py install

(If you are reading this, you probably already did the first step.)
The last step might require admin privileges in order to write into
the site-packages directory of your Python installation.

If you are using Python 2.6, apply python2_6.patch after the first
step:

 1a. Patch:
     $ patch -p1 < python2_6.patch

It removes the use of certain language features (dict comprehensions,
curly braces notation of sets, bytes string literal prefix 'b') that
were introduced in Python 2.7.


Documentation
-------------

The directory doc/html in the source distribution contains the API
documentation of python-icat in HTML form generated by Sphinx.  The
starting point is doc/html/index.html.

Example scripts can be found in doc/examples.  This is mostly an
unsorted collection of test scripts that I initially wrote for myself
to try things out.

Almost all scripts use example_data.yaml as input for test data.  Of
course for real production, the input will come from different
sources, out of some workflow from the site.  But this would be
dynamic and site specific and thus not suitable, neither for testing
nor for the inclusion into example scripts.  So its easier to have
just one blob of dummy input data in one single file.  That is also
the reason why the example scripts require PyYAML.


Test
----

There is no need to run the tests at all.  The test suite is mostly
useful to the maintainer of python-icat.

Mosts tests require a test ICAT server to talk to.  These tests are
disabled by default, unless you configure such a test server.  To do
so, place an icat.cfg file into tests/data.  This file must have at
least the configuration sections "root", "useroffice", "acord",
"ahau", "jbotu", "jdoe", "nbour", and "rbeck" with the options and
credentials to access the test server as the respective user.  See
doc/examples for an example.  Obviously, this implies that your
authentication plugin must also have these users configured.

**WARNING**: the tests are destructive!  They will delete all content
from the test server and replace it with example content.  Do not
configure the tests to access a production server!

You can sefely run the tests without configuring any test server.  You
will just get many skipped tests then.


Bugs and limitations
--------------------

 + For Python 2, the return value of the string representation
   operator of class Query may be a Unicode object if any of the
   conditions contains Unicode.  This violates the specification that
   requires the result to be a string object.  But it makes non-ascii
   characters in queries work.  A formal correct implementation would
   be much more cumbersome and less useful.  For Python 3, there is no
   distinction between Unicode and string objects anyway.

 + The entries in the no_proxy configuration variable are matched
   against the host part of the URL by simple string comparison.  The
   host is excluded from proxy use if its name ends with any item in
   no_proxy.  It is not checked whether the matching part starts with
   a domain component.  E.g. setting no_proxy=ion.example.org will not
   only exclude icat.ion.example.org, but also lion.example.org,
   although the latter is not in the ion.example.org domain.  IP
   adresses are not supported in no_proxy.  This is a limitation in
   the implementation of the underlying Python library.

 + There is a bug in the original version of Suds: the way it deals
   with datetime values is broken.  Suds converts all incoming
   datetime values from the server into what it believes to be local
   time and then throws all time zone information away.  The problem
   is that Suds' conception of the local time is flawed such that the
   result from this conversion may be wrong.  There is no reliable way
   to fix the values afterwards.

   One can work around this by setting the local time zone to UTC.
   (The conversion to UTC is done correctly in Suds.)  As a result,
   all datetime values retrieved from the server will be in UTC, which
   at least is well defined.  You may either set the environment
   variable TZ to 'UTC' before calling your script or add the lines

     import os
     os.environ['TZ'] = 'UTC'

   at the beginning of your script.  This must be set before importing
   other modules (in particular suds) in order to be effective.

   As a general rule, python-icat assumes all datetime values that do
   not contain time zone information to be UTC.

   Note that the bug is fixed in the fork by Jurko Gospodnetić which
   is recommendated anyway.

 + With Python 3.1, icatdump.py emits a spurious error message like

     Exception ValueError: 'I/O operation on closed file.' 
     in <_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>' encoding='UTF-8'> ignored

   on exit when writing the dump file to stdout (the default).  You
   can happily ignore this message.  The cause is that icatdump.py
   closes its output file when finished and that Python 3.1 emits this
   error message on exit whenever stdout has been closed, even if
   there was no further output after closing.  I assume this is a bug
   in Python 3.1.

 + Misleading "context" is displayed in error tracebacks with Python
   3.1 and 3.2.  Python 3 introduced a "feature" called "Exception
   Chaining and Embedded Tracebacks"[10].  This causes irrelevant and
   misleading "error context" to be displayed in the traceback of
   error messages.  python-icat tries to suppress this in the most
   annoying cases, but this suppression mechanism is only available
   with Python 3.3 and newer[11].


Version numbering
-----------------

Version numbers of python-icat comply with Python standards as defined
in PEP 440[12].  They try to adhere to the principles of Semantic
Versioning[13], but may deviate from the formatting defined therein
when it is incompatible with PEP 440.
