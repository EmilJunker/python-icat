      python-icat - A library for writing ICAT clients in Python
      ==========================================================

This package provides a collection of modules for writing Python
programs that access an ICAT[1] service using the SOAP interface.  It
is based on Suds[2] and extends it with ICAT specific features.


System Requirements
-------------------

 + Python 2.7
   Python 2.6 will do but requires patching the sources, see below.

 + Suds 0.4

 + PyYAML[3]
   Only needed to run the example scripts.  Not required to install or
   use python-icat itself.

 + argparse[4]
   Only if you are using Python 2.6 or older, argparse became part of
   the Python standard library in 2.7.


Installation
------------

python-icat follows the standard Python conventions of packaging
source distributions.  See the documentation on Installing Python
Modules [5] for details or to customize the install process.

  1. Download the sources, unpack, and change into the source
     directory.

  2. Build:
     $ python setup.py build

  3. Install:
     $ python setup.py install

(If you are reading this, you probably already did the first step.)
The last step might require admin privileges in order to write into
the site-packages directory of your Python installation.

If you are using Python 2.6 or older, apply python2_6.patch after the
first step:

 1a. Patch:
     $ patch -p0 < python2_6.patch

It removes the use of dict comprehensions which were introduced in
Python 2.7.
